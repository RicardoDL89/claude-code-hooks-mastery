   - Cross-functional stakeholders (balanced technical and business language)

3. **Structure the Communication**: Organize information using appropriate format:
   - Executive summary for leadership
   - Detailed progress reports for project managers
   - Technical translation for business stakeholders

   - Include specific timelines and deliverables
